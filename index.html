Returning to Serbia in 1884 he briefly became the conductor of the <b>Kornelije Stanković choir of Belgrade</b>.</p>

<p>From 1885 to 1887 he studied music in <b>Leipzig</b>, Germany. Upon his return to Serbia in 1887 he became the conductor of the Belgrade singing society (<b>Belgrade Choir</b>). From 1887 to 1900 he taught music at the Belgrade high school, and in 1901 transferred to <b>Bogoslovija</b> (Belgrade Theological College) where he taught church singing.
